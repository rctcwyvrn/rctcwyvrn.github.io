8 month work term at CCCS
Java Software dev
Took over a core project’s development and maintenance;  adding new features, making bug fixes, and managing deployments.
Working knowledge of the current state of the art for automated malware analysis of all types
Built a Linux sandbox capable of emulating different instruction set architectures and router firmwares to analyze ELF malware, such as Mirai.
GeekWeek hackathon
Week-long hackathon held by the CCCS, focusing on improving open source technologies related to security.
My team worked on improving an open source Linux sandbox. My personal contribution was adding improved networking options to the sandbox, namely inetsim and mitmproxy to give the option to fully sandbox the malware, or to perform an automated man-in-the-middle attack on malicious traffic.
Java tasklist project
Cryptography mini-projects
Full solutions and writeups for the original 40 cryptopals challenges
~15 other cryptography CTF challenge solutions and writeups for events held by Google, Trend Micro, and BSides.
An implementation of some hash based signature schemes 
Factorpy
An interpreter for a programming language of my design
Factorpy is a dataflow programming language, using concurrent-by-default functions.
Implementation of the interpreter hit some roadblocks, so a new version with ML-like types is in the works, possibly in Haskell or Java.
python_bees
An implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm originally proposed by Karaboga in Python.
Funnily enough, this project was forked by some poor soul
Various python projects
py_spec is an audio visualizer in python with numpy and matplotlib. It makes a nice circular view, though the graphs aren’t particularly clean.
parker_squares was a set of 3 scripts attempting to find 3x3 magic squares made up of perfect squares, ranging from extremely naive to somewhat clever. But in the end none of them worked.
I wrote two programs for controlling an NXT robot. The first was fairly simple, using nxt_python and wii_python to control the robot with a wii remote. The second version added openCV and tried to perform facial detection to aim it’s claw attacks.
The project was going fine until I had to glue the new code to the old one, only to realize there were no python 3 versions of the wii nor nxt libraries. It quickly became a massive hassle and I gave up.
CTF 
Participated in many CTF with the UBC team, Maple Bacon.
Examples of challenge writeups can be found on our team website, ubcctf.github.io and my personal website
Ranked #1 in Canada at the end of 2019 despite the team only forming in February 2019
Personal blog    
My personal blog. Articles written in markdown and compiled to HTML with pandoc through Hakyll. Lots of personal modifications for code styles, LaTex support, some CSS, extra tags, and scripts to help with maintenance. Hosted with github pages <3 
tldr; simple blog using Hakyll and haskell instead of Jerkyll and javascript because I wanna be a hipster
Math TA
Sci1 research projects
