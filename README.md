# github-page

My blog uses hakyll. Hakyll is a haskell based static html generator which allows me to write everything in markdown and have it publish into html with lots of cool templating stuff. Also it's in haskell, how cool is that?  

Don't look too carefully at the branches or how I deploy this website...  
It's not pretty... but it's what they had on the hakyll tutorial page :woman_shrugging:
