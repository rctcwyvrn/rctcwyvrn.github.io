<p>Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/ctf_stuff/tree/master/utctf/galois">here</a></p>
<p>As you probably read in the title, this is a writeup about a crypto challenge involving nonce repeition. Namely an AES-GCM challenge, where we are given an encrypted ciphertext and a encryption/decrpytion oracle, but no tag to go along with our ciphertext.</p>
<h2 id="gcm-mode">GCM Mode</h2>
<p>What is GCM mode? Well as I learned last weekend, GCM (Galois counting mode) mode is a cool little cipher mode that generates 2 things at once using your symmetric cipher 1. A ciphertext<br />
2. A tag which can be used to verify both identity and integrity</p>
<p>The ciphertext is fairly straightforward, it’s just the ciphertext that you would get from CTR mode, namely the plaintext XOR the keystream generated by encrypting a counter.</p>
<p>The tag is a bit more complex, it’s generated using the ciphertext and the encryption key as follows. (I’m going to ignore the auth-data, but it just adds more clutter and not much elses)</p>
<p>Consider a ciphertext C 10 bytes long.<br />
1. Calculate the length v = bitlen(last block of C, split into 8 byte blocks), so in our case the last block is 2 bytes so the bitlen is 16<br />
2. Calculate the following polynomial under GF(2^128), the Galois field with 128 elements. I’ll explain in a bit more detail what that means later.<br />
\[ f(x) = C_1x^3 + C_2x^2 + vx + E_k(nonce)\] Where C_1 and C_2 are the two ciphertext blocks, with C_2 padded to 8 bytes and E_k represents encryption using the cipher and key<br />
3. The tag T is then just f(H), where H is the encryption key and H = E_k(A string of 128 0’s)</p>
<p>So how does one evaluate things in GF(2^128)? I have no fucking clue. Just kidding I know a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="galois-fields">Galois fields</h2>
<p>A Galois field or finite field is just that, a field (a set with addition and multiplication operators) with a finite number of elements. I honestly don’t have the math chops to really give a good explanation, but what I do understand is that addition under this field is XOR, which will be important for the attack. Google a 3b1b video or smth. I might update this after I take my algerbra course next year.</p>
<h2 id="the-attack">The attack</h2>
<p>So one look at the code and you’ll see that the nonce and key are generated at the same time, and never changed. The attack we want to employ is nicknamed <code>The forbidden attack</code>, probably because if you mess up your crypto this badly you deserve to be banished into the shadow realm.</p>
<p>Here’s the attack in a nutshell. Assume we’ve sent and collected 8 byte ciphertexts C_a and C_b and their corresponding tags T_a and T_b.<br />
Our tags will be generated using \[ f(x) = C_ax^2 + v_ax + E_k(nonce)\] So \[ T_a = f(H) = C_{a}H^2 + v_aH + E_k(nonce)\] Unfortunately, we don’t know what H is, but what we can do is search for roots of this polynomial, so lets modify f. Let \[ f’(x) = C_ax^2 + v_ax + E_k(nonce) + T_a\] So now the root of f’ will be our encryption key \[ f’(H) = C_aH^2 + v_aH + E_k(nonce) + T_a = T_a + T_a = 0\] Note: Why does T_a + T_a = 0, because (+) in the field is XOR as mentioned earlier</p>
<p>The problem is that we don’t know all of f’, namely we don’t know what E_k(nonce) is. If only it was constant and there was some way of elimiating it…<br />
Let \[ g’(x) = C_bx^2 + v_bx + E_k(nonce) + T_b\] \[ h(x) = g’(x) + f’(x)\] \[ h(x) = (C_a + C_b)x^2 + v_ax + v_bx + E_k(nonce) + E_k(nonce) + T_a + T_b\] \[ h(x) = (C_a + C_b)x^2 + (v_a + v_b)x + T_a + T_b\]</p>
<p>Well that was easy! So the attack is then very straightforward<br />
1. Collect pairs of ciphertexts and their tags encrypted under the same nonce<br />
2. Generate h(x) for each pair and find the root(s)<br />
3. Decide that the root that appeared the most times must be the correct value of H</p>
<p>So now what do we do with the hash_key H? What we would love to do is generate a tag for the flag, but looking at the tag equation \[ T_{flag} = f_{flag}(H) = C_{flag}H^2 + v_{flag}H + E_k(nonce)\]</p>
<p>We still don’t know the value of the encrypted nonce. Now if only that nonce was constant and there was some way of eliminating it…</p>
<p>Let g be the tag function for a known ciphertext/tag pair<br />
\[ g(x) + f_{flag}(x) = (C_a + C_{flag})x^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})x\] \[ g(H) + f_{flag}(H) = (C_a + C_{flag})H^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})H\] \[ T_{flag} = (C_a + C_{flag})H^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})H - T_a\]</p>
<p>Well that was also easy wasn’t it.</p>

<p>Note: I used <code>nonce-disrespect</code>’s recover and forge to actually recover H and generate the tag for the flag. <a href="https://github.com/nonce-disrespect/nonce-disrespect">Source</a></p>
