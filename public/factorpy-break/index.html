factorpy, taking a break for now
</h1>

        
&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-a-break&quot;&gt;Taking a break&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rctcwyvrn&#x2F;factorpy&quot;&gt;factorpy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is in a decent place right now, if I could just get the list of things I want to get done working. But my motivation to work on the project has dropped down to basically nothing so I&#x27;m just going to leave it for now, maybe I&#x27;ll actually finish it in the future. Probably not&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;turns-out-my-idea-isn-t-new&quot;&gt;Turns out my idea isn&#x27;t new&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working out my initial idea for factorpy I spent a long time looking to see what programming paradigm it fell into, and I ended up deciding that it was just too stupid to have ever been thought of before. But I was wrong, totally wrong. Turns out that factorpy falls into the programming paradigm called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dataflow_programming&quot;&gt;dataflow programming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I realized this as I was watching a computerphile bonus video where they ask about favorite programming languages, and one guy said LabView. When he described it I thought, huh that sounds alot like factorpy. Turns it straight up is factorpy. Turns out lots of dataflow programming languages exist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also turns out that dataflow programming languages have many uses and had lots of research put into it in the 1980&#x27;s. One big feature is that they easily translate to visual programming, which is good for those who don&#x27;t know how to code. It is also very useful in certain workflows, such as in machine learning. Turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensorflow.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;tensorflow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a very popular machine learning package for python, is based on dataflow programming (tensor &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who would&#x27;ve thought my dumb idea was actually not that dumb after all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking around I didn&#x27;t find any dataflow programming languages that were nearly as clear and easy to read as factorpy so maybe my language still has a niche to fill. Gives me a bit of motivation to keep working on it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being I&#x27;m just gonna work on other stuff (how has no one written an interpreter for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snowflake&quot;&gt;Snowflake&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; yet?) and maybe spend some time poking around other dataflow languages and see if they are compiled and if so, how.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
