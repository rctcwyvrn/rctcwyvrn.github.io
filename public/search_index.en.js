They were fun, difficult, unique, and very rewarding. In hindsight, there really wasn't any close staring at the code for bugs or googling for similar problems in past CTFs for any of these challenges. Most of them were just good ol' math, and not extremely difficult math either.\nI'm rambling, but they were really really good challenges, and I had a ton of fun. So much fun that I accidently missed out on some talks I had wanted to attend. But hey I solved all the crypto and our team got 5th so that's something right?\nAnyway, on with the writeups\nSquared away\nFlag 1 (150 points)\nDefinitely the easiest crypto challenge of the 4, but still a fairly high point value.\nThe challenge is to decode a ciphertext for the Rabin cryptosystem given a decryption oracle. The catch is that it won't let you submit the encrypted flag itself, but it'll happily decrypt everything else.\nThe attack is then very straightforward, since Rabin is \"just RSA with e=2\" for the purposes of this challenge, we can apply the same kind of attack we would use for a similar problem in RSA, namely a blinding attack. We can just send the ciphertext C multiplied by 4, which will decrypt to the plaintext (which is the flag) times 2. So just multiply the thing we get back by inverse(2) mod n and we get our flag.\nflag{mal13ab1litY_sucK5}\nFlag 2 (200 points)\nThis one was much tougher to crack since it had a major red herring. The challenge was to factor the modulus and the server ran it's own prime generation algorithm, which made it seem like that was the vulnerability was hiding.\nBut nope, the vulnerability was actually Rabin's inherent weakness to chosen ciphertext attacks. Since I couldn't find any well documented guides on how to pull off this attack, I'll try to explain it in detail.\nHow does Rabin work?\n\nGenerate two primes p and q that are both 3 mod 4\nEncrypt using pow(m,2,n)\nDecrypt using some math magic to generate the 4 valid square roots of m in the modulo integer ring\nReturn the root that resembles the message\n\nThe \"resembling the message\" part is done by adding some redundancy to the message before encrypting\n\nTake the message you want to encrypt\nAppend on an copy of the last byte\nThen encrypt it by doing pow(m,2,n)\nWhen decrypting, return the root that has a duplicated last byte (after stripping off the redundancy)\n\nNote: This is not the standard way to do redundancy, you'll see why in a second\nWhy do we need to make sure that we return the correct root? Because if we don't and return all 4 roots, then anyone can factor the modulus.\ngod im too lazy to relearn how to use latex\nAssume we have our first two roots, x and -x mod n\nx^2  = S + n*j\nAnd we can convince the server to return us the other two roots, h and -h mod n\nh^2 = S + n*k\nThen\nx^2 - h^2 = (j-k)*n\n(x+h)(x-h) = (j-k)*n\nAnd we know that n is the product of exactly 2 primes, so a simple gcd between x+h % n and n gives us one of our primes.\nSo how do we trick the decryption oracle into giving us h?\nIf we give it x^2 mod n where x is properly redundant, then we just get x back.\nIf we give it x^2 mod n where x is not properly redundant, then we get usually get an error message because the server can't find a redundant root.\nBut there's the trick, we only usually get an error message back. We sometimes choose an x that doesn't have the redundancy property, but x^2 mod n happens to have a root that does have the redundancy property, in which case the oracle happily gives us that root (with the redundant byte stripped off). This happens reasonably often because of how weak the redundancy property is, in standard operation the last 64 bits, or 8 bytes get duplicated, instead of just 1 byte.\nSo all we have to do is send random x^2 mod n's until the server responds with a non-error.\nThis means that either:\n\nWe accidently hit an x that has the redundancy property and we get x back, in which case we just keep going\nWe hit an x^2 mod n that has a root h with the redundancy property, and the server returned us h with the redundant byte stripped off\n\nIn the second case all we need to do is to re-add the redundant byte and calculate the gcd to get our factors!\nSorry, no flag because I forgot to save it... I figured out the last half of the solution in the last 15 minutes of the CTF. I got my first valid h about 5 before the end and submitted the flag as the organizers made their way to the front to close off the event. Talk about cutting it about as close as physically possible lol.\nMeme generator (200 points)\nCredits for the solve to Xander (I really hope I didn't remember/spell your name wrong...)\nThis one was another one with red herrings. An RSA signing forgery challenge that doesn't involve Bleichenbacher's e=3 attack? Impossible!!\nSo here's the challenge:\n\nWe can submit left and right text to the meme generator, which gets added to a bash command to generate the meme.\nThis command gets signed and sent to the server\nThe server verifies the signature and runs the command if it is valid\nThe result of the command (which is usually the image bytes) gets base64'd and sent back to the webpage.\n\nThe details:\n\ne=65537\nSelf implemented PKCS1.5 padding\nSignature check is done by calculating the signature from the message, and comparing to the one that was given. This cuts out the aforementioned Bleichenbacher attack since the entire signature is checked, and also cuts out any padding oracle attack since the padding validity is never checked on it's own\n2048 bit RSA\nPrime generation from a crypto library\n\nIf you've looked at the challenge code yourself, you might be wondering why I bothered listing out all these small details and other attacks when there's obviously something weird in the padding function.\n\nThe hash is only the first 6 bytes! We can just manipulate the hash of the command with our inputs until we hit a collision between the command's hash and the hash of, lets say, ls | xargs cat.\nOne slight problem, brute forcing 6 bytes is still on the order of 2^48, much too high for pedestrian hardware. So thinking this was a dead end, I moved on to try and find vulnerabilities elsewhere, leading to the list details that I had up there and eventually to me just giving up. However one of my teammates figured out the correct approach, the birthday attack.\nThe birthday attack is just a cryptographic attack using the birthday paradox as it's basis. Google \"Birthday paradox\" if you don't know what it is, there's hundreds of people who have done a better job explaining it than I could (also I'm lazy).\nBut how do we apply it to colliding hashes? Much like how the chance of finding a birthday pair is surprisingly high given a small n, we can make the probability of a collision between two groups of hashes surprisingly high given a small set of hashes.\nHere's how:\n\nGenerate a big list of hashes (ideally 2^24 but we managed with a much smaller list) that you want to find a collision against. In our case we used ls | xargs cat; echo &lt;random ascii letters&gt;\nStart generating hashes for values that you can control, in our case this would be hashes that we could get out of valid inputs to the meme generator.\nContinue until you find a collision between the hashes from 1 and a hash from 2.\n\nBut wait, how is that any faster? Think about each hash that you generate in the second step. Each one gets compared against 2^24 hashes, meaning on average you only need to generate 2^24 hashes in the second step to find a collision (2^48 total comparisons).\nSo we expect to only generate 2 * 2^24 hashes, and since creating a hash is a lot more time consuming than just comparing two hashes, our much lower # of hashes makes the collision finding much much faster. So now all that's left is to find collisions for the commands we want to execute and voila! Flag!\nflag{48_b1ts_sH0u1D_b3_en0ugH_f0R_4ny0n3}\nOld school (400 points and a prize for first solve)\nThe one that most people reading this writeup are actually interested in.\nSome context, this challenge was the only challenge worth this amount, I think the next highest was 300? Even so there weren't very many above or at 200 at all, most challenges were in the 50-150 point range. And to top it off, the first solver would be awarded a mysterious prize, which ended up being a Hak5 WiFi Pineapple nano!\nNow I'm telling you this because I want to show off how cool I am for being the first solve and being only one of two teams that ended up solving this challenge, but really me winning the prize was me getting lucky. They actually doubled the point value and announced the prize on the morning of the second day, and lucky me decided to work on this challenge for most of the first day and had gotten the flag right after the event had stopped on the first day, so I got to walk in on the second day and collect my 400 points and my prize!\nThe challenge itself was actually pretty clear in terms of what we had break and how. We're given a decryption oracle that runs NDS, New Data Seal. Our job is to decrypt the given ciphertext. Like Squared Away 1 , the oracle does check if we try to submit a block that matches the ciphertext but this time we can't do any blinding tricks.\nSo what is the algorithm we're dealing with here? New Data Seal is a Feistel cipher based symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed at IBM at around the same time as DES. The short Wikipedia article actually gives us only bit of intel that we need to get started, NDS is vulnerable to a type of attack called a slide attack (NDS was actually the cipher that this attack was first demonstrated with!) .\nSlide attacks???\nWhat is a slide attack? I barely understand it myself since I didn't bother trying to find a textbook with a proper explanation. I can try to explain the high level idea though. Most modern symmetric ciphers (eg AES and DES) are based on rounds of substitutions and permutations.\nEach \"round\" of the cipher usually consists of something like\n\nAdding the key to the ciphertext (eg using XOR)\nSubstituting\nPermutating\n\nFor example in AES each round a key gets mixed in, some bytes are substituted using an s-box, the \"rows\" are shifted, and then the \"columns\" are mixed together. The goal is to mix the key into each round such that it's difficult to figure out where bytes of the plaintext and bytes of the key end up in the final ciphertext. This is made especially difficult when the # of rounds is high, so even if you can figure out some properties after one round, after 16 rounds all traces of them are (hopefully) gone.\nSo what is a slide attack? A slide attack accomplishes the goal of not having to worry about the number of rounds, and instead focus on brute forcing out what happens during one round, or more specifically one key cycle.\nAfter like 3 paragraphs, here's the one line answer to what a slide attack is:\nLet F be one or multiple rounds of a block cipher where after F rounds the key that gets \"mixed\" in is the same as the one in the first round. For the sake of simplicity (and since NDS has a cycle count of 1 anyway), we're going to assume F represents one round of the 16 round cipher.\nSo we can represent the encryption function E as just F(F(...F(plaintext)...)), as 16 individual rounds. From this representation we see that F(E(ptxt)) is actually equal to E(F(ptxt)).\nSlide attacks are attacks abusing this property of block ciphers to completely ignore the problem with the number of rounds. Since people at the time believed that more rounds would solve all of their problems (cough cough triple DES), this type of attack was (probably? I have no idea but it seems like it was) very important.\nThe actual attack on NDS\nTheory out of the way, what's the attack?\nNDS is a Feistel cipher as mentioned before, which means in each round you\n\nSplit the block in half\nThe new left block is the old right block\nThe new right block is  = old_left XOR F(old_right, key)\n\nWhere F is that round function I mentioned before. What is F in NDS?\nNDS's round function F:\n\nTakes the first bit of each of the bytes in the 8 byte input (NDS has a 16 byte block size, so old_right is 8 bytes)\nConverts it to a number i \\in [0:255] and take the ith byte of the key (NDS has a massive 256 byte key)\nUses that byte of the key in some complex permutations and stuff that you don't need to worry about\n\nHow do we use the slide attack property to recover the secret key?\nThe idea is that we can guess what a byte of the secret key is, and know if we were right or not by looking at what the decryption returns.\n\nSend the server the message M to get E(M)\nGuess that the secret byte that get's used in the first round is b\nCalculate F(M) using that b\nSend F(M) to the server to get E(F(M))\nCompare E(M) and E(F(M))\n\nWe know that if we guessed b correctly, then F will correctly simulate the first round of the cipher, which means F(E(M)) will be E(F(M)). But to calculate F(E(M)) we would need another F function and another key byte guess...\nBUT we have a Feistel cipher, and we know that only half of the block actually uses the key. This means we can check if F(E(M)) == E(F(M)) while only having to guess one byte of the key at a time!\n\nGuess a key byte and use it for calculating F(M)\nIf it was correct then we should see that E(M) is one round behind E(F(M)))\nIn the context of a Feistel cipher, one round behind means that the right block of E(M) is equal to the left block of E(F(M))\n\nSo all we need to do is to do that for each guess b until we hit one that has that right block left block match, and then do that for every single one of the 256 key bytes and we have our entire secret key!\nflag{n3w_d4ta_s3al_is_old_sk00l}\nNote: We want to control which byte of the key gets used in the first round so we need to choose our message carefully. If we want to get the 14th byte of the key, then we want the first bits of the 8 bytes on the right to be 00001110, so we send a message of\n&lt;whatever 8 bytes you want&gt; || \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x00\nThis guarantees that the first round of NDS will use the 14th key byte, so once we find our slide pair (? not sure if that's a slide pair but w/e) we know that we just found the 14th key byte.\nThanks to Julie for finding some random university notes that I was able to slowly figure out the attack from. (ctrl+f \"new data seal\" to find the section)\nI just randomly found this presentation that I wish I had found during the CTF, but oh well. Gonna read it later, seems like a much better general explanation of slide attacks. Hopefully it doesn't show that I have no idea what I'm talking about.\nAnyway that's it. Try the old school if you have time, it's a good exercise I think.

There are plenty of other tutorials, so look for a better one if this one makes no sense\nThis is gonna mostly be a tutorial for how to do this byte stuff in python, which is really unintuitive to me anyway\nNOTE: Some of the most trouble I had in these challenges was getting the data to the right types, and it involved lots and lots of stackoverflow and following other guides, remember there's no shame in doing that and don't feel bad when you see your 10th TypeError in a row\nChallenge 1: Convert hex to base64\nFor this challenge you just need to know how to do this stuff in python, I used the codecs library\nDecode: Some encoded format like hex or base64 or ascii --&gt; bytearray\nEncode: bytearray --&gt; Some encoded format like hex or base64 or ascii\nSo following the hint you convert like this: hex -&gt; bytes -&gt; base64\nHere's some examples for how it works\n\nChallenge 2: Fixed XOR\nFor this one you want to use python's ^ operator, which acts on two bytes and returns the logical XOR\nSo the steps are\n\nConvert both hex strings to bytes\nCreate a new bytearray for the output\nLoop on the bytearrays for the two input strings\nAppend the result of ^ to the output\nEncode the output bytes back to hex (im too lazy to check if i actually have to do this)\n\nChallenge 3 Single-byte XOR cipher\nI see why these are in order now...\nTheoretically it's not hard, the problem for me was getting the stupid python syntax correct...\nHere's the framework\n\nConvert to bytes as usual\nLoop from 0 to 255 to loop over all the possible single chars\nDo a single-byte xor on each of those, here's code from the tutorial I found\n\n\nSource: https://laconicwolf.com/2018/05/29/cryptopals-challenge-3-single-byte-xor-cipher-in-python/\nFor all the other python things, follow along with laconicwolf and google.

You can redo the code from aside 1 with this new information btw\nChallenge 5: Repeating-key XOR\nMostly a combination of what we've seen already, I would reccomend making sure you can do this on your own before reading any guides, since it should be mostly copy paste from challenges 3 and 4\n\nTake the key and plaintext\nConvert the plaintext into bytes\nLoop over the bytes and append on bytes([ord(key[count]) ^ byte]) where count is incremented and modded over the length of the keystring\nReturn and you're done!\n\nChallenge 6: Break repeating-key XOR\nThe big bad!\nPart 1: Hamming distance function\nList of mistakes I made along the way\n\nYou want to compare bits, not bytes, so convert the byte (which is really just an int) into a string of bits (Stackoverflow it, no shame in doing so)\nThe bits may not have the same length, so you need to add the distance between their lengths to the dist\nMake sure you are indexing the string in the right direction\nMake sure not to index off the end of the bit string\n\nPart 2: Rest of the fucking owl\nHonestly I don't know how my code managed to be bug free, but it somehow was...\nHere's the functions I used:\n\nhdist(bytes1,bytes2), hamming distance function\ntake_block(in_bytes, a, b), returns the bytes from a to b\nblockify(in_bytes, block_size), converts the bytes into a list of block_size sized bytes\ntranspose(blocks), takes the list from blockify and transposes it as detailed in the challenge (step 6)\nbreak_repeating_key_xor(enc_bytes, guess_len), the big boi\n\nhdist was explained in part 1 and the other functions are fairly self explanatory except for 5.\nHere's what break_repeating_key_xor() did:\n\nLoop over keysizes from 2 to guess_len\nBreak the entire...

There's defintely one or two off by one bugs in my code too.\nChallenge 7 AES in ECB mode\nI'm stupid and didn't read the instructions, do this in code because you'll need it alot later. I used pycrpyto\nChallenge 8 Detecting AES in ECB mode\nThe main part of the challenge is figuring out how to actually detect ECB encryption, and the hint isn't super helpful.\nThe idea is that if there is a duplicate 16 byte plaintext in the original message, then it will also be duplicated in the ECB. But why we can assume that there is duplicated plaintext is beyond me...\nHere's what I followed: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20941/why-shouldnt-i-use-ecb-encryption\nand https://obrien.io/writeups/crypto/2018/02/01/cryptopals-set-1-writeup/ to check my answers\nAnyway you want to do the type wrangling you're probably used to now\n\nOpen the file\nlines = f.readlines()\nfor line in lines\nunhexlify(line.strip()), the strip() is important!

Pretty fun but also defintely frustrating at times when you get nothing but TypeErrors for 20 minutes straight trying to convert the input to what you want.\nSet 2 coming soon tmtm\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/crypto-set1/","title":"Cryptopals Set 1 writeup"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/crypto-set234/":{"body":"Set 2\nChallenge 9: PKCS#7 padding\nFairly straightforward. Helpful tip: bytes([number]) will make bytes like b'\\number' for the padding\nChallenge 10: CBC mode\nAES is how the actual encryption/decrpytion happens\nECB is the function from set 1 that takes 16 bytes and a key to encode/decode\nCBC then extends that to arbitrary length as long as its multiples of 16 bytes long\nHonestly the hardest part was understanding what the challenge was even asking for\n\nTake the file\nDecode into bytes\nSplit into blocks of size 16\nTake the first block and decode it with AES with the key\nXOR that with the IV, append it to the return\nRepeat except XOR the each decoded block with the previous block, not decoded, also append it to the return\n\nplay that funky music\nChallenge 11: Oracle\nThis one was fairly straightforward, write the oracle as they describe and use the same ECB detector from earlier challenges\nChallenge 12: One byte at a time (easy)\nThis one looks straightforward at first, and it kind of is. Getting the first byte is easy but the harder part is getting your code to automate the process for going through the rest of it\nGeneral description of my code:\n\nStart with sending 15 bytes of A's\nGet a byte of the secret by sending 15 A's and a guess\nSend 14 A's\nGet the next byte of the secret by sending 14 A's + the byte of the secret you got earlier + a guess\nRepeat until you get a full 16 bytes of the secret\nLoop back to sending 15 bytes of A's\nGet the next byte by sending 15 A's + 16 bytes of secret + a guess\nRemember to compare against the second block now\n\nSo by pure luck I managed to get this all packaged nicely into two for loops, good luck!\nChallenge 13: ECB Cut and paste\nThe title is a pretty big hint, the idea is that you want to copy over some ciphertext of what you want and paste it in\nSo\n\nMake a bogus account that you're going to edit admin into, make sure that the role part is in its own block\nMake a second account with admin in it's name where the word \"admin\" is at the beginning of a block\nCut the block from the second ciphertext and paste it into the second\n???\nProfit!\n\nChallenge 14: Byte at a time (harder)\nI got stuck on this one for awhile because I wasn't sure how difficult the challenge was supposed to be.\n\nIs the prefix length random for each time you call the oracle?\nAre the prefix bytes random for each time you call the oracle?\n\nI wrote my solution assuming no to both of those. The only real change from challenge 12 is that you need to find the prefix length first and change your first block accordingly\nTo find the prefix length just send A's of increasing length, eventually the first block will go from\nprefix + A's + first byte of secret to\nprefix + A's\nAnd then after that the first block will stay constant, so just look for when the first block starts to be the same as the last and you get your prefix length\nIdeas for the harder version:\nIf prefix length and value was random each time the problem is that you need a method of determining prefix length given any ciphertext\nIf only the length was random then maybe if you could manage to get the prefix, maybe something like sending 20 A's and always looking at the first block and then just copy pasting that onto future blocks?\nChallenge 15: Padding verifier+stripper\nEasy peasy?\nChallenge 16: CBC bitflipping\nImagine ciphertext with blocks A,B,C...\nRemember that CBC decrypts block B by putting it through AES decryption, lets say decrypt(B) = x, and then xors it with the previous ciphertext A\nSo if we have a block of encrypted \"A\"s in B then we just need to modify the block A so that when it gets xor'd with x it becomes \";admin=true;\"\n\nWe can change reality A to be whatever we want since we have access to the ciphertext,\nsnaps fingers\nNow A is replaced with A xor \";admin=true;\" xor \"AAAAAAA\"\nSo when CBC decrypts it the first block becomes jarbled, but when it does the second block\n\nAnd we're in!\nSet 3\nChallenge 17: Padding oracle attack\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack\nThe idea is that since the server/function you're attacking will tell you if padding is valid, try random things until you end up with a last byte of \\0x01, which will return as proper padding\nCiphertext blocks = c1 c2\nSo you can mess with the ciphertext however you want, completely rewrite c1\nLet c1 = 15 * \"A\" + a random int i\nNow trace the CBC decryption process, c2 -&gt; intermediate 2 using AES\nThen intermediate 2 xor c1 = plaintext block\nThe idea is that you can now just try random ints i until the plaintext block ends in \\0x01, and the oracle will tell you because it'll be the only attempt that results in valid padding\nSo now you know i XOR last byte of the intermediate = \\0x01, so last byte of the intermdiate = \\0x01 XOR i, and you just stole a byte of unencrypted intermediate\nTo get the plaintext you just xor it with the original ciphertext as part of the normal CBC proccess\nMuch like earlier challenges, this attack is not theoretically difficult but it is very hard to get working correctly in actuality. Some tips:\n\nPrint statements everywhere\nStart with just the loop for finding one byte, then make it work for 16 bytes, then make it work for all blocks\nThe very first block of the ciphertext is tricky, you can either mess with the IV or make a reordered ciphertext like I did\nLike the hint says, the fact that the actual plaintext is padded is actually completely irrelevant. Make sure you understand why this is before moving on, it's an important conceptual link.\n\nPitfalls:\n\nMake sure that you are generating the correct bytes in c1 for the bytes that you already know the intermediate values of\nMake sure your verify+strip function from set 2 is bugless, it should accept a block that is all padding but reject a block with no padding\nA general coding tip but you should try to keep your eventual goal in mind as you build up the function\nYou decrypt the bytes in reverse order, so make sure you account for that\nAt the very end remember to XOR the intermediates with the IV + cipher_text\n\nChallenge 18: CTR Mode\nThe wikipedia article for CTR mode gives a good explanation, and overall CTR mode is very simple, just don't be dumb like me and get your key and block reversed\nCTR\nAlso remember to use little endian versions of the nonce and counter: Endianness , if you don't know it basically means the bytes are stored in reverse order of what we expect; least significant bytes first.\nChallenge 19/20: Breaking a constant nonce CTR\nI'm not sure what they wanted for challenge 19, I just wrote the code for what I thought they wanted me to do and ended up doing challenge 20...\nI went straight for the way we broke repeating key XOR in set 1, where you guess all possible bytes it could be and generate a score from the resulting XOR's\nAlso this is the first challenge so far where the first time I ran the code it worked! Congrats to me!!!\nChallenge 21: Implementing some PRNG\nI didn't like this challenge at all to be honest, I understand wanting us to learn how the twister worked but just copying down some psuedocode doesn't really do that.\nI just traced the algorithm a few times and then copied the code from someone's solutions\nChallenge 22: Break time seeding PRNG\nFairly straightforward, just try all the seeds near the current time and you'll find one that matches\nChallenge 23: Untemper and clone MT\nThis one was not coding difficult, but was a bit mathematically tricky to understand.\nLooking at the last tempering, y =x xor (x&gt;&gt; 18) we can get the general pattern for how we want to solve these.\ny gets shifted right by 18, so the largest 18 bits of y must come directly from x, then the smaller bits of y come from x xor x &gt;&gt; 18. We can then recover x one bit at a time because\nx_n = y_n xor x_(n-18) n=18...\nAnd it turns out this approach works for the other type of shift and also the ones with &amp; so yay\nThe cloning part is simple, just make a constructor that takes a MT state array instead of a seed\nChallenge 24: Write the MT stream cipher and break it\nWriting the cipher: straightforward\nBreaking it: Not obvious but it turns out that 2^16 keys isn't that many keys, and testing them is very quick. So you can literally just test all the keys\nVery unclimactic....\nYou can modify the function to look for whatever you want, I made it look for things that looked like english sentences.\nSet 4\nChallenge 25: Break read/write AES CTR\nTldr; don't let people mess with ciphertexts in any way\nSo we can change the plaintext to say whatever we want, so why not make it all 0's? If it's all 0's then the ciphertext will just be the keystream, and with the keystream we can just xor it with the original ciphertext\nChallenge 26: CTR bitflipping\nThe function will remove all ;'s and ='s so we need to trick it into encrypting something that has the admin token, which is very simple because CTR just uses XOR\nlet x = admintoken\ny = AAAAAAAAAA\n\nSend the function x XOR y, which will just be random garbled text\nIt'll encrypt it and send back x XOR y XOR stream\nTake the ciphertext and XOR it with y again to get x XOR stream\nSend back x XOR stream to the decoder, which will happily decode it back to x\nProfit!\n\nChallenge 27: Steal the key from IV=Key CBC\nWhy would anyone do this...but I bet the cryptopals team have seen this enough which is why it's here but still.\nThe instructions actually give a very detailed explanation for the attack, nothing much that I really want to add. Go back to the wikipedia article if you've forgotten exactly how CBC works. Make sure you understand why the attack works instead of just copying the instructions!\nChallenge 28: Implement a SHA-1 MAC\nThe implementation I used: link\nFor the fellow crypto noob, MAC stands for Message Authentication Code. The idea is that the hashing function (sha-1) takes the message+key and generates a hash. The important part of this hash is that small modifications to the resulting hash do not correspond in any way to small changes to the plaintext that was sent, so no bitflipping attacks or anything like that.\nSo in an actual setting:\n\nAlice and Bob share a key\nAlice tells Bob she is sending message X\nAlice sends Bob sha-1(key+x)\nBob recieves the hash and compares it with his own sha-1(key+x), and if they match then he authenticates her\n\nI'm guessing the messages x would all be something like \"auth=____\" with user/admin/whatever and Bob would just try them all until one worked, and then give out the proper authority. So to cheat this we need to be able to send fake hashes without knowing the key, which seems impossible at first beause a small change in input results in a completely different hash output.\nSHA stands for secure hash algorithm, so it's probably safe right?\nChallenge 29: Break SHA-1 Keyed MAC\nOh... \"Secret prefix SHA-1 MACs are trivially breakable\"\nI sort of fumbled my way though this one, and the instructions are super not helpful\nUseful information:\n\nSHA-1 works kinda like the twister from earlier, it has an internal state which it uses to generate it's result. So if we know the state we can generate more, which is why we need to do the same thing as the fake_twister where we could plug in the entire state array and use that as a clone, except this time we use our clone to generate a longer hash which includes our secret sauce\n\nHere's how SHA works (kinda)\n\nTake an input and turn it into bits\nAppend a 1\nAppend 0's until the length is 448\nThe length of the message is converted into 64 bits and added to make a mod 512 == 0 bit message\nEach 512 bit chunk is then put through the hashing function with an internal state, the state updating for each block\nAt the very end it returns the state variables concatenated together\n\nSo since each 512 bit chunk is done seperately, if we can make a sha-1 clone that has the correct state of just finishing the last block of the original message, we can continue on and hash whatever we want\nSo the plan is\n\nGet state from hash, which coresponds to hashing key+message+padding\nCreate a fake sha-1 with that state\nAsk the fake sha-1 to hash a ;admin=true; token\nThe result turns out to be the same as if you asked it to hash key+message+padding+token, which is exactly what we wanted\n\nI was confused for a while about why we needed to go through the hassle of generating the padding, it's so that we can check to make sure that the hash is what we wanted, and for literally no other reason. We can generate the fake key+message+padding+token but if we wanted to make sure its right we need to actually hash key+message+padding+token\nChallenge 30: Break MD4 Keyed MAC\nAlmost identical to challenge 29, but the padding for MD4 uses a little endian representation of the msg length, not big endian like SHA-1\nChallenge 31: Artificial timing leak HMAC-SHA1\nSo the main hint for this challenge comes from the aptly named insecure_compare function. How can we exploit the fact that it compares one byte at a time and delays?\nThe idea is that we can just try all the possible first bytes, and for one of them the insecure_compare will find one correct byte and delay once, and for the rest it won't delay at all.\nThe plan:\n\nGuess a byte\nMake known_signature + guess\nPad it out to 40 bytes\nSend it and record the time taken\nFloor time_taken / delay to get the number of successful compares that insecure_compare did\nIf that's greater than what we already have then add it on to known and loop\n\nThis one takes forever to run on the default 50ms delay though, my solution worked until 20ms delays so I would try running that first\nChallenge 32: Less artificial timing leak\nHow to make the attack more consistent? Replace step 5 because the delays are too small to really be consistent, instead just make a list of all the times and take whatever guess caused the longest time. Also running each guess 3 times and taking the average probably helps.\nMy solution worked for 5ms delays but not really for anything less. Maybe taking the 10 longest times and running them all 10 times each, then taking the longest time out of that to be the best?\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/crypto-set234/","title":"Cryptopals sets 2,3,4 writeups"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy-break/":{"body":"Taking a break\nfactorpy is in a decent place right now, if I could just get the list of things I want to get done working. But my motivation to work on the project has dropped down to basically nothing so I'm just going to leave it for now, maybe I'll actually finish it in the future. Probably not\nTurns out my idea isn't new\nAfter working out my initial idea for factorpy I spent a long time looking to see what programming paradigm it fell into, and I ended up deciding that it was just too stupid to have ever been thought of before. But I was wrong, totally wrong. Turns out that factorpy falls into the programming paradigm called dataflow programming. I realized this as I was watching a computerphile bonus video where they ask about favorite programming languages, and one guy said LabView. When he described it I thought, huh that sounds alot like factorpy. Turns it straight up is factorpy. Turns out lots of dataflow programming languages exist.\nIt also turns out that dataflow programming languages have many uses and had lots of research put into it in the 1980's. One big feature is that they easily translate to visual programming, which is good for those who don't know how to code. It is also very useful in certain workflows, such as in machine learning. Turns out that tensorflow, a very popular machine learning package for python, is based on dataflow programming (tensor flow).\nWho would've thought my dumb idea was actually not that dumb after all.\nAfter looking around I didn't find any dataflow programming languages that were nearly as clear and easy to read as factorpy so maybe my language still has a niche to fill. Gives me a bit of motivation to keep working on it.\nFor the time being I'm just gonna work on other stuff (how has no one written an interpreter for Snowflake yet?) and maybe spend some time poking around other dataflow languages and see if they are compiled and if so, how.\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy-break/","title":"factorpy, taking a break for now"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy/":{"body":"What is factorpy?\nFactorpy is an interpreted language with a unique syntax and python interoperability.\nAn example of factorpy code:\n\nFactorpy code defines what goes into a function and where it's output should go. So in this example the programmer wants the input to the factorial() factory to be used twice, once as an input to the sub1() factory, which sends it's output to a new factorial() factory which sends it's output to the multiplication function. This looks (and to be honest is) stupid and complex.\nWhy?\nFactorpy was made with 0 goals in mind, but as I wrote it I thought of what it may be used for, and the main one was to help new programmers. Factorpy solves one and only one of the problems some newcomers to coding may have, the control flow. We as programmers intuitively understand that code is run one command at a time, but to a newcomer this may be unintuitive. The solution is to have code run concurrently, much like a real world assembly line.\nThis is all of course an excuse for me to mess around with writing a programming language. I think it's quite cool but I don't want to bother trying to justify it's existence. It's a fun side project and should be treated as such. More esolang than innovative new programming paradigm.\nOther important details about factorpy\n\nYou can import python functions and (in the future) just write straight python to define factories in factorpy files\nAs mentioned earlier, the code runs concurrent by default, ie every function tries to run and will simply wait if there is no input.\nThe current interpreter is a mess and should be used with caution\n\nWho?\nFactorpy is a personal project of mine, it's current state is a giant mess of spaghetti python code and terrible hacks. But it kinda works! Note that in the example above there is no base case, that would be because I haven't figured out how to do that just yet. Note #2, the above code does not run on the current compiler, as it does not support recursion yet.\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy/","title":"factorpy, what is it?"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/galois-writeup/":{"body":"Code can be found here\nAs you probably read in the title, this is a writeup about a crypto challenge involving nonce repeition. Namely an AES-GCM challenge, where we are given an encrypted ciphertext and a encryption/decrpytion oracle, but no tag to go along with our ciphertext.\nGCM Mode\nWhat is GCM mode? Well as I learned last weekend, GCM (Galois counting mode) mode is a cool little cipher mode that generates 2 things at once using your symmetric cipher\n\nA ciphertext\nA tag which can be used to verify both identity and integrity\n\nThe ciphertext is fairly straightforward, it's just the ciphertext that you would get from CTR mode, namely the plaintext XOR the keystream generated by encrypting a counter.\nThe tag is a bit more complex, it's generated using the ciphertext and the encryption key as follows. (I'm going to ignore the auth-data, but it just adds more clutter and not much elses)\nConsider a ciphertext C 10 bytes long.\n\nCalculate the length v = bitlen(last block of C, split into 8 byte blocks), so in our case the last block is 2 bytes so the bitlen is 16\nCalculate the following polynomial under GF(2^128), the Galois field with 128 elements. I'll explain in a bit more detail what that means later.\n\\[ f(x) = C_1x^3 + C_2x^2 + vx + E_k(nonce)\\]\nWhere C_1 and C_2 are the two ciphertext blocks, with C_2 padded to 8 bytes and E_k represents encryption using the cipher and key\nThe tag T is then just f(H), where H is the encryption key and H = E_k(A string of 128 0's)\n\nSo how does one evaluate things in GF(2^128)? I have no fucking clue. Just kidding I know a little bit.\nGalois fields\nA Galois field or finite field is just that, a field (a set with addition and multiplication operators) with a finite number of elements. I honestly don't have the math chops to really give a good explanation, but what I do understand is that addition under this field is XOR, which will be important for the attack. Google a 3b1b video or smth. I might update this after I take my algerbra course next year.\nThe attack\nSo one look at the code and you'll see that the nonce and key are generated at the same time, and never changed. The attack we want to employ is nicknamed The forbidden attack, probably because if you mess up your crypto this badly you deserve to be banished into the shadow realm.\nHere's the attack in a nutshell. Assume we've sent and collected 8 byte ciphertexts C_a and C_b and their corresponding tags T_a and T_b.\nOur tags will be generated using\n\\[ f(x) = C_ax^2 + v_ax + E_k(nonce)\\]\nSo\n\\[ T_a = f(H) = C_{a}H^2 + v_aH + E_k(nonce)\\]\nUnfortunately, we don't know what H is, but what we can do is search for roots of this polynomial, so lets modify f. Let\n\\[ f'(x) = C_ax^2 + v_ax + E_k(nonce) + T_a\\]\nSo now the root of f' will be our encryption key\n\\[ f'(H) = C_aH^2 + v_aH + E_k(nonce) + T_a = T_a + T_a = 0\\]\nNote: Why does T_a + T_a = 0, because (+) in the field is XOR as mentioned earlier\nThe problem is that we don't know all of f', namely we don't know what E_k(nonce) is. If only it was constant and there was some way of elimiating it...\nLet\n\\[ g'(x) = C_bx^2 + v_bx + E_k(nonce) + T_b\\]\n\\[ h(x) = g'(x) + f'(x)\\]\n\\[ h(x) = (C_a + C_b)x^2 + v_ax + v_bx + E_k(nonce) + E_k(nonce) + T_a + T_b\\]\n\\[ h(x) = (C_a + C_b)x^2 + (v_a + v_b)x + T_a + T_b\\]\nWell that was easy! So the attack is then very straightforward\n\nCollect pairs of ciphertexts and their tags encrypted under the same nonce\nGenerate h(x) for each pair and find the root(s)\nDecide that the root that appeared the most times must be the correct value of H\n\nSo now what do we do with the hash_key H? What we would love to do is generate a tag for the flag, but looking at the tag equation\n\\[ T_{flag} = f_{flag}(H) = C_{flag}H^2 + v_{flag}H + E_k(nonce)\\]\nWe still don't know the value of the encrypted nonce. Now if only that nonce was constant and there was some way of eliminating it...\nLet g be the tag function for a known ciphertext/tag pair\n\\[ g(x) + f_{flag}(x) = (C_a + C_{flag})x^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})x\\]\n\\[ g(H) + f_{flag}(H) = (C_a + C_{flag})H^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})H\\]\n\\[ T_{flag} = (C_a + C_{flag})H^2 + (v_a + v_{flag})H - T_a\\]\nWell that was also easy wasn't it.\nutflag{6cm_f0rb1dd3n_4774ck_777}\nNote: I used nonce-disrespect's recover and forge to actually recover H and generate the tag for the flag.

Remember kids, never repeat a nonce!"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/google-crypto-writeup/":{"body":"Code can be found here\nQuantum Key Distribution\nTwo of the three crypto challenges this CTF were kinda different from the standard, they both gave very detailed descriptions of the challenge but used very odd/unknown systems. This challenge basically boiled down to \"can you understand quantum cryptography?\"\nSo let's get into it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84\nBB84 has the following steps:\n\nAlice generates random 512 bit numbers a and b\nAlice sends the qubits, with the ith qubit  being the encoding of the ith bit of a under the basis determined by the ith bit of b\nBob recieves said qubits and measures each qubit under a random basis\nAlice and Bob exchange the list of bases that they used\nThey discard any bits where they used different bases and take the remaining bits as the shared key\nThey can then do some other thing to account for possible mistakes/disruptions but that doesn't apply here\n\nNow lets compare that to the instructions given by the challenge, we see that the steps are kinda out of order. We send Bob (the satellite) the basis and the qubits at the same time and it responds with it's basis and an \"announcement\". If we computute the shared secret then we see that it's not the same as the announcement but does have the same bit length.\nHmmmmm. The page is vague with it's language and it's description of the announcement, using the words \"shared secret\" and \"key\" and \"encrypted secret\" kinda randomly.\nLet's think about this from a meta perspective then. The qubits and the basis that we send the server are randomly generated, so the shared secret is random, but we know that the challenge is to find a hex key that decrypts the AES-CBC encrypted flag. Also we see that the announcement that we get back is different every time.\nHmmmmmmm. So we can guess that the \"announcement\" we get back is the key we want mixed together with the shared secret. We can generate the shared seceret ourselves since the satellite returns the basis it used, but how did they combine the key with the shared secret? We see that they're the same bit length so why not try XOR?\nRun it a few times and we see that the result of announcement XOR shared_secret is constant! We have our key!\nCTF{you_performed_a_quantum_key_exchange_with_a_satellite}\nReversing Cellular Automata\nThe second of the two weird systems. This one is very straightforward though, \"just\" reverse a step in the cellular automata.\nHere is the rule in question.\nIt generates the nth bit by looking at the left (n-1), center (n), and right (n+1) bits. And rule 126 was chosen because of how it generates that bit. If LCR are all 0's or all 1's then the nth bit is 0, otherwise it's 1.\nNaive attempt #1:\nWell we can just make a list of lists, where the nth entry in the big list is a list of all possible triplets centered at the nth bit, then zip them all together. If the resulting bit is 0 then the possible triplets are 0,0,0 and 1,1,1 etc.\nRun it and what happens? Python spits out a MemoryError...\nLet's just do a quick calculation to see how many elements are in that big list\n3027636133969523175486328123886577647616\nOh...\nNaive attempt #2:\nOk lets try incorporating the previous bit into the calculation. But then we run into a problem.\nIf the output bit was \"1\" and the last bit was \"0\", that leaves us with three possible choices,  the triplet could be 010, 001, or 011. We can try to keep track of all of these but we can only start excluding them once we finish a full loop around, and even so we have so many elements in the list that python chugs and itertools can't make the combinations for us.\nThis approach doesn't seem like a good idea, let's try something else.\nLess naive attempt #3:\nLet's look at the patterns generated from rule 126\nhttps://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=rule+126+random+initial+conditions\nHuh, we see lots of upsidedown triangles. If we consider the rule itself it makes sense. Groups of bits tend to \"move\" towards each other since something like 100 will result in 110 potentially. Also lines of 111111 become 1000001 which then begin to move towards each other, forming the upsidedown triangles we see.\nSo using what we know of the patterns can we look at the pattern from 66de3c1bf87fdfcf and backtrack? Assume that each sequence of 0's was generated by a line ofe 1's and seperated 1's are part of an upsidedown triangle? The answer is no. It doesn't work. The assumptions end up creating a pattern that isn't even a valid previous state. So at this point I had been at it for a few hours so I went for a walk and immediately figured it out. It was so obvious.\nFinally the successful attempt, attempt #4:\nBrute force. We can just brute force previous states and keep the ones that step into the obtained step.\nThe key itself is 64 bits long, so brute force on the entire key is impossible. But cellular automata are not hashing functions. Normally a hash function cannot be realistically brute forced because a 1 bit change in the input results in a completely different hash.\nBut with the cellular automata a 1 bit change on one side of the input only affects a small local area, the 3 neighbouring bits that will use it in it's calculation. This means we can split the key into 6 10ish bit long segments with some overlap, apply the automata to all the numbers between 0 and 2^10^-1 and keep track of all the states that match our desired segment, and then merge the patterns together. This takes time 6 * 2^10^ instead of 2^64^!\nOne important part to consider is that when stepping this automata we need to not consider the outermost bits, because we don't want to find solutions where the wrap around neighbours are impactful since the substrings are gonna be concatenated together later. Did that sentence make sense? Probably not. Try it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.\nSo use python's itertools to generate the list of all the combinations of the solutions we found for each segment, merge the segments together, and validate them by checking that the next state for them is 66de3c1bf87fdfcf.\nNow we have a list of around 10,000 potential keys, which is actually reasonable. I wrote a short bash script and looped through until I found a key that didn't result in a bad decrypt, however the encryption scheme doesn't actually check the integrity of the entire message, it only checks that the padding is ok before deciding that the decrpytion worked, which just made things a bit more complicated, but eventually the script finds the flag!\nCTF{reversing_cellular_automatas_can_be_done_bit_by_bit}\nPS: Guessing from the flag I don't think I did this challenge in the intended way, but whatever! Flag is flag!\nReality\nA more classic kind of CTF crypto problem, just a confusing hint and a port to netcat to.\nLet's break down the information we have.\nConnecting to the port gives us:\n\nAn encrypted flag\nThree \"coefficients\" that are pairs of real numbers with 500 decimal places of precision, the first is small and the second is around 10^40^\nA message: \"You need 5 coefficients to decrypt the flag, here's 3\"\n\nHuh, weird. Let's look closely at the challenge, the name is \"reality\" and the description mentions someone called \"Shamir\".\nWho is Shamir? This of course refers to Adi Shamir one of the creators of RSA (He's the S in RSA). But we have a bunch of real numbers, while RSA uses exclusively integer rings. Hm, let's keep looking.\nGoogling his name we find something called Shamir's Secret Sharing, which is a secret sharing scheme where everyone is given a coefficient and n-people need to be present to generate the secret. This works by using the fact that you need k points to uniquely define a k-1th order polynomial (if you're not sure why this is true, consider taking k derivatives of a k-1th order polynomial and trying to work backwards using integration), and if you have less than k points you have an infinite number of possible k-1th order polynomials that cross those points.\nSo seems to be the challenge, we have 3 coefficients, now we just need the last two.\nBut how? We have literally an infinite number of possible polynomials that could all be the secret.\nAs usual with these CTF problems one must look and see what is different from the usual, and use that to guide the way. The obvious weird thing is the massive amount of precision with the numbers that we are given and the title \"Reality\". Hmm, reality, real numbers? Maybe the precision is somehow making the secret sharing system insecure? The system usually works by giving each member a pair of an integer n and the coefficient for x^n^ so the system we have here is definitely different.\nI didn't have a clue where to go from there, but resident genius Robert Xiao had an idea immediately. Can we make this into a lattice problem? More specifically a closest vector problem where the solution is the desired coefficients? This might work because the massive amount of decimal precision!\nThe problem we're interested for this challenge is called the closest vector problem (CVP). It boils down to this:\nGiven a matrix A and a vector v, what vector x, with the constraint that x is made up of integers, results in the Ax that is closest to v and what is that \"closest vector\" vector Ax?\nWe want our closest vector problem to solve for the integer coefficients that make up the polynomial. Here's our equations, we know that it's in this form because the challenge said we needed 5 coefficients to decode the flag.\n\\begin{equation}\ny_1 = c_0 + c_1  x_1 + c_2  x_1^2 + c_3  x_1^3 + c_4  x_1^4   \\\\\ny_2 = c_0 + c_1  x_2 + c_2  x_2^2 + c_3  x_2^3 + c_4  x_2^4  \\\\\ny_3 = c_0 + c_1  x_3 + c_2  x_3^2 + c_3  x_3^3 + c_4  x_3^4  \\\\\n\\end{equation}\nNow into a matrix,\n\\begin{equation}\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 &amp; x_1 &amp; x_1^2 &amp; x_1^3 &amp; x_1^4 \\\\\n1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_2^2 &amp; x_2^3 &amp; x_2^4 \\\\\n1 &amp; x_3 &amp; x_3^2 &amp; x_3^3 &amp; x_3^4 \\\\\n1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nThe goal vector,\n\\begin{equation}\nv=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3 \\\\\nc_0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nRemember CVP finds integer valued x such that $Ax=v$. So given this we expect that the CVP will find\n\\begin{equation}\nx=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_0 \\\\\nc_1 \\\\\nc_2 \\\\\nc_3 \\\\\nc_4 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nand return us a vector that is close to (and hopefully close enough so that c0 will be valid)\n\\begin{equation}\nres=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3 \\\\\nc_0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nwhich we can extract the secret, c0, out from.\nThe problem is that we don't know what c0 is, so we can't give use the goal vector as written.\nThe solution I ended up using was to guess and make it insignificant, ie multiply everything in the matrix and the y's by a large scaling factor so that the algorithm \"doesn't care as much\" about the difference between our guessed c0 and what we want it to return, the actual c0.\nAnother solution could be to invert the matrix and multiply in the [y1,y2,y3] vector but I only just thought of that.\nSo that's the general idea, I ended up adding a few more rows onto the matrix to get the CVP function from fpyll to work, but eventually I got there.\nSo now we have a massive int, c0. How to decrypt the flag? This was basically just trial and error, I eventually noticed that it was about right to be converted into 16 bytes, which is the key length that is required for the encryption scheme that they used in the earlier challenges (AES-CBC).\nAnd it worked! AES-CBC with the key being c0 and IV being just b'\\x00's resulted in our flag!\nCTF{h0w-r3al-is-y0ur-Re4l-4Real}\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/google-crypto-writeup/","title":"Google CTF 2019 Crypto challenges writeup"},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/intro-crypto/":{"body":"Cryptography has always been about one goal: Making a system for communicating between two parties securely. As the internet has grown and hackers have gotten smarter, the systems to keep secrets have gotten more and more complex to combat them.\nHere is a basic rundown of the foundational concepts in cryptography in terms of the problem they aim to solve. This outlines (sort of) how cryptography was developed,\n\nNew technique/idea/system\nProblems with the new system\nNew techniques/ideas/systems to solve the new problems\nRepeat\n\nProblem: If someone gets ahold of my message then they can read its contents\nSolution: Encryption. Encryption is the idea that the message can be \"locked\" in such a way that anyone who reads it without the key can't determine the original message. There are two ways to do encryption, one that works as you would expect and one that seems to work by mathematical magic.\nSymmetric key ciphers\nThe seemingly obvious way first: Symmetric key ciphers. You and your partner have an identical key, you lock the message and send it to them, which they can then unlock. Anyone without the key has no way of opening the message because they don't have the key. Examples of this type of cipher include AES-256 and RC4. But this introduces a new problem:\nProblem: How do you get you and your partner to have the same key?\nSolution: Key exchanges.\nPublic key exchange\nThe core idea of key exchange protocols is that both parties mix together their secret keys with some public value, and exchange the results. Then you mix your secret with what your partner sent you (their secret mixed with some public value) and they do the same, leaving you both with both secrets mixed with the public value.\nThe mathematical trick is that the mixing is irreversible, if someone were to steal the secret mixed with public value, they would be unable to extract the secret out of it. The common metaphor is mixing two colours together, it's very difficult to extract out what the two original colours were without just brute force.\nNow everything should be fine right?\nProblem: How do you know that the person you're talking to is your partner? How do you know that the message hasn't been tampered with?\nIf you're having trouble imagining how this could possibly happen, imagine the same public key exchange, but with someone in the middle pretending to be your partner while your real partner is wondering why you haven't sent them anything. You and the middle-man end up establishing a key and then you end up sending messages to them that they can unlock with the key you just established with them.\nSolution:Remember how I mentioned there were two ways of doing encryption? The solution to this problem is the other form of encryption, public key based encryption.\nPublic key encryption\nInstead of explaining the math, here is how it works in practice. Imagine a wizard gave you two magic keys that had a simple property, whatever you locked with one key can only be unlocked by the other key.\nYou could then make duplicates of one of the keys (lets call it the public key) and give it to all of your friends, and keep the other one hidden away (called the private key). If friend A wants to send you a message they can lock it with the public key you gave them. The message is then safe from everyone but you, because only you have the the private key which is required to unlock it.\nNow to solve the problem of man-in-the-middle attacks on key exchanges you can just slightly modify the procedure.\n\nMix your secret with the public value\nLock it with your private key\nSend it to your partner\nYour partner can then try to unlock it with the public key you gave them\nIf it unlocks properly then your partner knows the message was from you, because only you have that private key\nContinue as normal\n\nThis procedure is called \"signing\".\nThe magical keys come from the magical land of mathematics, and range from points on curves to matrices to prime numbers. The most famous of them all is RSA. I am hesitant to even mention RSA because despite its fame and success during it's time, it is now extremely dangerous to actually implement. The one you should use is Elliptical Curve Cryptography.\nSo everything should be fine now right?\nProblem: This one is kinda complicated. The obvious problem is that most public key encryption is slow. The other problem is that RSA keys are not ephemeral, ie randomly generated. Rather public/private keys are stored for potentially months at a time. This means that if someone steals your private key, they can use it for a long time to lots of bad things.\nSolution: Use public key encryption to initially get a randomly generated shared secret secured between the parties, and then use MACs to guarentee sender identity and message integrity afterwards.\nMessage authentication codes (MACs)\nThe goal is to attach something to each message that an attacker cannot replicate, so you know to not accept any messages that does not have the correct tag. The tag needs to do two things, it needs to be unique for each message and contain information that only your partner would know (some predetermined secret). The tag also needs to be made in such a way so that an attacker can't stop a message and pull out the secret from it.\nMethod 1: Use a cipher. The basic idea is that you can just lock the message and send both the message and it's locked version. When your partner receives it they can just unlock and see if it matches the other message. (It's a bit more complicated than that though)\nMethod 2: Use a cryptographic hash function.\nHashing functions\nCryptographic hash functions are functions that take any message of any length and convert it to a fixed length, say 16 bytes, of data. They also have the unique property that if the original message is even slightly different, the result will be completely different. This means that the only way to get the original message from the resulting 16 bytes is to test all possible messages until you get one that hashes to the desired result.\nNow to make a MAC from this you can mix the message with the secret and then hash it. Then when your partner receives it they can mix the message with the secret in the same way and check that the hash is correct. If an attacker wants to change the message or pretend to be you, then they need to have the secret.\nThat should be the basic rundown for the core concepts of cryptography. Here is everything we talked about summed up in the standard way connections are secured over the internet, TLS.\nA client wants to talk to a server securely\n\nThe client generates a random number, and the public value mixed with that random number (Diffie-Hellman key exchange)\nThe client encrypts this with the server's public key (So the client knows only the server could decrypt it)\nThe server does the same steps for the key exchange\nBoth parties calculate a shared secret, which was just randomly generated (Ephemeral keys)\nBoth parties then use that key to encrypt everything they send between each other (AES encryption)\nThey also include a MAC that guarentees the message's integrity and the sender's identity (HMAC)\n\nImportant thing not mentioned: Certificates and certificate authorities, look them up if you're curious, it's basically a third party that vouches for the server.\nTo look further:\n\nWikipedia\nComputerphile videos detailing Diffie-hellman key exchanges and man in the middle attacks\ncryptopals for a whirlwind tour of how to break cryptography. Note: side effects include a sense of dread when realizing most security code is written poorly and even small mistakes lead to broken systems.\n\n","id":"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/intro-crypto/","title":"A brief introduction to modern cryptography"}},"docInfo":{"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/about-hakyll/":{"body":189,"title":2},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/bsides-crypto/":{"body":1480,"title":5},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/crypto-set1/":{"body":742,"title":4},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/crypto-set234/":{"body":1434,"title":4},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy-break/":{"body":185,"title":4},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/factorpy/":{"body":181,"title":1},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/galois-writeup/":{"body":435,"title":7},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/google-crypto-writeup/":{"body":1141,"title":6},"https://rctcwyvrn.github.io/intro-crypto/":{"body":700,"title":4}},"length":10},"lang":"English"}
