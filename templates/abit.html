<h2>About this series</h2>
<p>A brief introduction to ___ is a series where I give the basic ideas of a given topic. Usually this means not going into technical detail but rather giving a more overarching/ big picture view of a topic.</p>
<p>I think these types of articles are great for when you want to get into a topic, but there are so many words and so many concepts that itâ€™s hard to get your footing at first. My goal with each of these posts is to give enough of a conceptual basis that you can read the wikipedia article about a topic in that field and not be completely lost.</p>
