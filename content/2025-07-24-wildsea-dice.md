## actions
- forged in the dark system

1. Build your dice pool
- Add 1d6 for the edge you want to use
- add up to 3d6 for relevant languages/skills
- add up to 2d6 advantage dice

2. Describe the action

3. Roll and note the highest roll
- 6 is a triumph, no drawbacks
- 4/5 is a conflict, success with a drawback
- 1/2/3 is a disaster, failure with a complication/drawback
- Doubles = twist

Twists
- Everyone except the dice roller suggests an unexpected outcome of the roll
- should never
	- invalidate or override the roll
	- force a player to accept something about their character that they hadn't planned

Cutting
- removing dice results starting from the highest
- cut reasons
	- because of difficulty (dm will say so)
	- for precision (take 1 cut for precision)
	- for impact (take 1 cut for impact)

Impact
- low
- normal
- high 
- massive
- scales based on how impactful the chosen action would be in real life, would it be average (kicking a door), below average (kicking a reinforced door), above average (kicking a rusty door), or super massive (ramming a ship into a door)

## edges
- how do you attempt to solve the problem?
- grace, iron, instinct, sharps, teeth, rides, veils 
- adds 1d6 to your dice pool
- inherently flexible, and should give some inspiration/direction for how you want to approach a problem
- page 80

## skills
- areas where you have expertise, giving you a natural advantage 
- brace, break, concoct, cook, delve, flourish, hack, harvest, hunt, outwit, rattle, scavenge, sense, study, sway, tend, vault, wave walk
- also flexible, but not as much as edges, be creative
- each skill has a rank from 1-3, are that many d6 to your roll using that skill
- general recommendations: something to traverse (wave walk, vault, outwit, delve), something to survive/fight (break, hack, Hunt, flourish, brace, vault), something to acquire (hunt, scavenge, harvest), something to uncover (outwit, study, sense)
- page 82
- you can always do things without skills, it just means you aren't as good at it

## languages
- similar to skills, rank 1-3
- smattering, knowledge, fluency
- languages are powerful, and grant you cultural knowledge and lore
	- low sour: default language
	- chthonic: ancient human language, gives ancient human lore
	- saprekk: ektus language, gives lore of the ektus and deserts, heat, and sand
	- gaudimm: gau language, gau lore, knowledge of caves and tunnels
	- knock: tzelicrae language, tzelicrae lore, understanding of insects
	- brasstongue: merchant language, grants knowledge of cargo routes and negotiation tactics
	- raka spit: hunter language, lore about beasts and birds 
	- lyre-bite: songwriter language, deeper understanding of whispers, pre-v songs
	- old hand: sign language, understanding of relics
	- signalling: flag/flare/signal lamp language of travellers, grants understanding of ships, weather types, and seagoing hazards
	- highvin: scholarly ancient language, pre-v lore
## aspects
- traits, gear, and companions
- traits
	- properties of yourself that make you unique (ie youre really big)
- aspects form your hp, when you take damage you mark off on your aspects track
	- mark an appropriate aspect for the kind of damage you take, but this can be flexible/creative

aspect development/modification
- usually takes a project and a milestone
- results in a change in the track for an aspect
	- increase the track at the cost of complications/limitations
	- decrease the track to gain powerful abilities
- aspects can also be combined
	- new name, new type, track = sum of the two original tracks, add all additional rules
	- be creative!
## mires
- insecurities, phobias, savage tendencies
- each mire is a two box track
- mires are marked when you do something fucked up or see something fucked up or something bad happens to you
	- when your character experiences the horrors of the sea or turns to savagery
- narrative
	- one marked mire: let hints of the condition bleed into your roleplay, show your difficulty
	- two marked mire: let it be the forefront of your roleplay, show your suffering
- mechanical
	- automatically cut equal to the mire's marks whenever you go against it

## drives
- motivations, goals, what drives your character to sail
- whenever you advance your goal, get one of
	- a whisper
	- clear a mark of mire
	- a minor milestone
	- a major milestone

## milestones
- rewards for completing narrative goals, things important to your character
- used for modifying aspects, improving a skill/language, and gaining new aspects

minor
- once per session after doing something that has a small but lasting effect on your character
- examples: personal goals, memorable npc encounters, surviving a hard-won fight

major
- same idea, but should be recorded after a narrative arc that built up to some conclusion
- examples: solved a mystery, took down a pirate captain, visited the under-eaves

usage
- take tasks with a narratively appropriate milestone to progress projects
	- minor = fill one box
	- major = fill three boxes
- projects
	- 3 track
		- add a box to an aspect
		- develop an aspect (add a rule)
		- gain a new skill rank
		- gain a new language rank
	- 6 track
		- gain a new aspect
		- combine two aspects
## resources
- can be used/consumed to gain advantage on action rolls if appropriate
- salvage
	- inorganic material salvaged
	- repair gear, craft new gear, attack
- specimens
	- organic bounty of the wildsea
	- heal traits, cook meals, attack
- whispers
	- words that have power
	- discover secret information (speaking them under your breath), twist the narrative of the world (by speaking them aloud), force a change in the world (by shouting them)
- charts
	- documents, maps, information
	- discover locations, record safe routes

## temporary tracks
- project tracks
- tracks for temporary benefits
- tracks for temporary injuries

benefits
- mark a box whenever you use it, once the track is full it's used up

injuries
- mark boxes with good nights rests, surgical care, and going to a med tent

## combat
golden rules
- no weapons needed, anything is a weapon if you try hard enough
- no combat skills needed, be creative
- focus is fluid, but tracked
- you can do a lot more than just attack while you have focus
- death is always an opt-in
- combat doesnt always end in a defeated foe

combat mechanics
- damage taken and dealt out is represented by marking tracks and aspects 
	- a successful hit means dealing one mark of damage
- attacks can also have extra effects, like disabling aspects, leaving them vulnerable, etc.
- 12 different damage types
- positioning on the battlefield is important for determining cuts/advantage
- characters always get a chance to react to attacks from enemies

## ship 

Basics

Ratings
 - ship stats
 - roll dice equal to the number of unmarked boxes in the rating

Taking damage
- takes damage to the rating boxes
- Could also damage a room/structure of the ship
- Could also damage cargo

Journey mechanics 

Stations
- helm (required)
- watch (required)
- engine 
- maps
- weather watch

Helm
- three options for journey progress
- cut a path: decent speed, one box of progress
- forge ahead: swift progress, two boxes of progress, no chance for the watch to spot anything
- drop anchor: ship stops and everyone rests, undercrew takes over watch, time to work on projects/repairs

Watch
- roll a single d6
- page 73 for the watch roll table results, potentially leading to an encounter
- making a discovery
  - consume a chart and a whisper to make a discovery 

Engine
- normal tending to the engine
- throw extra fuel in to take advantage of the extra speed
- cover up the engine to take advantage of the extra stealthiness

Cartigraphising
- creation of charts of where you're travelling through
- mechanic: a track

Weather watching
- roll a 1d6 and use the table on page 75

# character creation
- pick a bloodline, an origin, and a post
- then follow the quickstart kit for each of the choices to end up with a full character!
	- should have 3 edges, 15 skill ranks, 6 aspects, 6 resources, 3 drives, 3 mires
	- follow the rightmost section on each page + pick two aspects from each of bloodline, origin, and post
