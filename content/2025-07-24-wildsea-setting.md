## core concepts
- treetops are a sea
- land is scarce and valuable
- plant growth is rampant
- open flames are forbidden
- crezzerin corrupts on contact
- economy is barter based
- its a weird weird world
	- arconautics (unknown and uncanny, whispers, spirits)

## important terminology
- pre-verdant
	- things from before the wildsea grew
	- prized for benefits they can offer (technology, material, etc.)
	- hard to obtain
- ironroot
	- foundation of the wildsea, massive trees, mile high
- tallshank
	- taller than the ironroots, spread up above the canopy
- spit
	- landmass on the surface of the canopy
	- temporary in nature
- island
	- not in danger of being swallowed by the sea
	- tips of mountains, monuments, or other large structures
	- heavily colonized, useful resource
- reef
	- collection of junk on top/just below the waves
	- hotspots for salvage and wildlife
- rift
	- hole in the sea that leads down to the roots
	- places of study and worship
- crezzerin
	- chemical substance concentrated in leaves and tree sap
	- drives the wild growth of the wildsea plants and the rapid evolution of the animals
	- corrupts on contact, minds warp and forms mutate

### sea layers
- skies
- thrash
	- top layers of the ironroots
- tangle
	- thicker branches below the thrash, where ships rest their hulls onto
- sink
	- darker, more dangerous, deeper parts below the tangle
	- where all the dangerous stuff lives
	- where ships go to die
- drown
	- the point of no return
	- branches thin out and light goes dark
- darkness-under-eaves
	- the roots of the sea and the bones of the old world
	- _the less said about this place, the better_

## species

### core four species of the new world
- Ardent
	- post-verdancy descendants of humans
- Ektus
	- tall cactus people
- Gau
	- fungal colonies become sentient
- Tzelicrae
	- hive mind of thousands of spiders
	- inhabit clothes or armor like hermit crabs
### rising species
- Ironbound
	- souls inhabiting iron and steel machines
- Ketra
	- also descendants of humans
	- diverged by being trapped underground during the verdancy
	- tentacled bodies and self made skeletons
- Mothryn
	- short lived, fragile moth creatures

## wildsailors
- set off onto the waves for various reasons
	- to explore, to salvage, to hunt, to trade, to adventure, to escape
- equipment
	- sporescarfs
		- barrier against airborne spores
	- rope and grapple
	- a blade
- draws 
	- freedom
	- knowledge
	- adventure
- drawbacks
	- danger
### travel
- charts and maps are highly valued
	- everything is constantly in flux
	- exchanging such information is highly respected
- wavewalking is highly dangerous
	- predators, falling, and crezzerin are all risks
### ships
- large chainsaw driven steel machines that ride atop the tangle and cut into the thrash

### dangers at sea
- crezzerin
- spores
	- some choking, infectious, or hallucinogenic
- the current season
	- spring insects, summer storms, rot of autumn
	- winter is universally feared and stops everyone from travelling as the waves become brittle and prone to shattering
- flora and fauna
	- insects, beasts, and birds
	- foxes and wolves
	- predatory plants
- cults 
- weather and waves
- mires
	- mental fatigue from being at sea
- fire
	- fire spreads almost infinitely on the wildsea since fuel constantly regrows and is literally everywhere
	- extremely dangerous

## civilization
- established port towns on solid ground
	- rare, large, full of people
- temporary spits on random pieces of ground that rise above the wildsea
	- more common, temporary, cramped
- roving fleet colonies, mycosanctums, floating skyports, tallshank branch towns
### ports and harbours
- markets
	- barter
	- scratch is the term for the lowest form of barter, basically just random junk
		- a handful of scrap for a drink
- junctions
	- places to sleep
- shipyards
- non-essentials
	- smokehouses
		- since fires are dangerous, smoke-houses are stone buildings
	- shadow-springs
		- hot springs
	- cartoika
		- cartographer houses
	- chop stations
		- meat preparation grill-houses

### food, drink, and cooking
- moving food is highly lucrative
- cooking without fire is hard but there are various methods
- fruits, nuts and berries are the core staples
- vegetables are rare due to the lack of land to farm
- meat from animals and insects are fairly common as well
- fungi and grains for vegetarian protein
- eggs are common
- ale, wine, mead are common drinks
- coffee and tea are possible, though difficult to heat up
- rare delicacies are things like flame roasted meats, or a glass of pure water

## culture
- lack of a defined culture across the different spits and ports
- laws
	- murder and fires are among the highest crimes
	- theft is looked down upon
	- scavenging and salvaging are protected activities
	- but otherwise its purely based on the peoples and their culture
		- different species have wildly different laws and rules
- vices
	- smoking, drinks, mood altering drugs
- sports
	- target practice, throwing insect nests, blindfolded sparring, races
- music
	- a great spectacle that always collects a crowd
	- a wide variety of different instruments (pg 23)

## technology
- modern technology, yet reliant on old world staples like sharp blades and crossbows due to the lack of industry
- everything is cobbled together out of driftwood and salvaged metal
- supply chains dont exist
- no fire, so no internal combustion or steam power or smelting
- common technologies
	- ship mounted chainsaws
	- chemical engines
	- salvage made clockworks
	- chains, ropes, pulleys
	- bone carved blades
	- crossbows/other string tension weapons
	- chemical propulsion firearms
- rare technology
	- engines become much stranger, living hives or acid filled maws
	- hulls become more stable
	- weapons become more dangerous and complex
	- communication moves from firebug signals to short range radios and semaphore towers
- engineers are in high demand
- pre-v technology sometimes emerges out of rootquakes, ripe for the salvage

##  spirituality 
- most people are deeply spiritual and believe in the existence of a soul
	- debate on what that actually entails
- whispers
	- "words with souls"
	- words that carry power when spoken
- religion
	- organized religion is rare
	- small groups isolated to single spits or islands are more common

## arconautics
- concentrated weirdness
- some examples of how to gain power
	- befriending a weird creature to gain its abilities
	- forging an uncanny material into a relic or tool
	- using alchemy to extract and ingest the essence of something strange
	- incorporating parts of the wilds into yourself
	- overcoming a weird injury that should have ended you
- must be trained after the potential is had
- messy, dangerous, painful, unpredictable
- arconauts are rare, most spits would have never seen one in action
	- non-wildsailors find that there are easier ways to get "power"
- **this is not magic**
	- everything can be explained, even if it's uncanny
	- its an art, a science, an exploration, but not magic
