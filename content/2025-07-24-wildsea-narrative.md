## focus
- whoever gets focus in the scene is a more explicit mechanic in wildsea
- ill keep track of whos got focus and make sure everyone gets their moments
- kinda works like "turns"

## tracks
- visual reminders of something that will be happening
- get marked one by one as the thing gets closer to happening

## scenes
exploration
- think about what the characters can see beyond just eyesight for the ardent
- think about what you can scavenge
- resource rolls
	- 6 = solid unmarred example of what youre looking for
	- 4/5 = negative tag
	- 1/2/3 = cant find or ruin it
	- twist = unique or positive tag
- locations to look for resources in
	- wrecks and ruins
	- reefs (collections of junk and rusting hulks)
	- spits and settlements
	- corpses and remains
	- the waves themselves

interaction
- information or favors typically requires an action roll
- language skills can stand in for typical skills (at cut/reduced impact)
- language skills provide cultural information

combat will be explained later

## montages
- for doing a sequence of actions quickly, splitting up the party, everyone getting a moment to do something
- not exclusively for downtime scenes, though downtime is often in montages

**Tasks**
- the unit of measurement for parts of a montage
- each montage is typically one task per person
- generally: exploration, acquisition, recovery, creation
- montage task examples: working on a project, tending to injuries, exploring, making a tool, picking fruit, getting some exercise, reading, stargazing, talking to crew, fixing the ship, cooking, hunting, meditating, theft
- generally represented by a single roll, same as typical action rolls

Exploration
- fairly straightforward 

Acquisition
- 6 means you get what you're looking for, 4/5 means it has a negative tag

Recovery
- 6 means recover two marks
- 4/5 means recover one mark
- homebrew: 1/2/3 means you recover zero (book says to take extra damage lmao)

Creation
- 6 means you get a 2 track temporary aspect
- 4/5 means a 2 track temporary aspect with a downside 
- 1/2/3 means you get nothing 
- twist = unexpected benefit

Projects
- long term, tracked, progress made during montage tasks
- ways to progress
- simple time
- making a roll (higher risk higher reward)
- using resources
- help from others


## journeys
- starts with a destination or goal in mind
- preparations: cargo, passengers, undercrew, a route, information 
- set off with a journey track (one track for progress, possibly others for risk, pathfinding, riot)
