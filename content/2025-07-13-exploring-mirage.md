How MirageOS compiles the OCaml: [https://github.com/mirage/functoria](https://github.com/mirage/functoria)


> Phases
>Configuration is separated into phases:

>Specialized DSL keys The specialized DSL's keys (along with functoria's keys) are resolved.
>Compilation and dynlink of the config file.
>Registering. When the register function is called, the list of jobs is recorded and immediately transformed into a graph.
>Switching keys and tree evaluation. The switching keys are the keys inside the [If]. Those keys are resolved and the graph is simplified. At this point, the actual modules used are fully known. Note: for the describe command, Only partial evaluation is done, which means decision nodes are resolved only if the value was given on the command line, disregarding default values.
>Full Key resolution. Once the actual modules are known, we can resolve all the keys and figure out libraries and packages.
>Dependency handling, configuration and code emission.
>Phases 1. to 4. are also applied for the clean command.


# `paf`

I wonder if I can steal `paf` as my http layer -> ie if the library can have it's entire backend swapped out for something else...

It kinda looks like the answer to that is yes?


> Paf wants to provide an agnostic implementation of HTTP with the ability to launch a server or a client from an user-defined context: a Mimic.ctx. It does not exist one and unique way to use Paf because the context can be: 
> a MirageOS
> a simple executable
> something else like a JavaScript script (with js_of_ocaml)
